-- GENERAL
Clean up the code
Transform/Object class
Input - partly finished
Editor viewport
Materials
Scenes
object GUIDS

-- LIGHTING
Point shadows
dynamic mapping of lights into shadow map
more control over light values being sent to shader
	such as using degrees when modifying spot light angle instead of cutoff

-- SHADERS
Ability to preproesses the shaders so they are all compiled and saved before running the exe
	so that we dont have to link to spriv or glslang (these are currently set up in a way that they need debug and x86
Match up locations/bindings between vertex/fragment dynamicly
Make shadow versions of shaders when generating

-- RENDERING
override textures and shaders when doing shadow pass

-- API
rendering pipelines
    normal and postprocessing
Improve Render targets
Text rendering/UI (ImGui is alright at this stage)

-- OTHER
Possibly vulkan
xbox/UWP?
